CATARINA — CODLING MOTH (APPLE) GLOSSARY
=====================================

CORE ENTITIES
-------------

Trap
A pheromone trap placed in the orchard to monitor codling moth activity.
Used for monitoring only, not control.

Pheromone Trap
A trap baited with a synthetic codling moth pheromone that attracts male moths.
Indicates timing of adult flight.

Trap / Block
The orchard block or area where the trap is located.
Growers think in blocks, not sensors.

Trap Check
A single event where a grower checks a trap and records what was caught.
Preferred term over “reading” or “measurement”.

Trap Catch
The number of codling moths caught in the trap since the last trap check.
Indicates moth activity, not population size.

Codling Moths Caught
Field label used in the app.
Represents new moths caught since the previous trap check.


TIME & PROCESS TERMS
--------------------

Check Date
The date when the trap was checked.

Days Since Last Check
The number of days between trap checks.
Calculated automatically by the system.

Biofix
The point in time when consistent codling moth activity is first detected in traps.
Used as a starting reference for development timing.
Not based on a single moth.

Flight
The period when adult codling moths are active and flying.
Detected using trap catches.

Flight Detected
Status indicating that moth activity has begun.

Flight Increasing
Status indicating rising trap catches over time.

Flight Tapering
Status indicating declining trap catches later in the flight period.


RISK & TIMING LANGUAGE (USER-FACING)
-----------------------------------

Risk Window
A limited period when pest activity and crop vulnerability overlap.
Used for planning and prioritization.

Risk Window Approaching
Indicates conditions suggest egg hatch may begin soon.

Active Risk Window
Indicates egg hatch and early larval movement are likely occurring.

Late Window
Indicates larvae are likely entering fruit and control effectiveness is reduced.

Timing Signal
A signal derived from trap catches and temperature trends
that helps indicate where the season is progressing.


BIOLOGY (SIMPLIFIED, SAFE)
-------------------------

Life Stage
A phase in the codling moth lifecycle (adult, egg, larva, pupa).

Egg Hatch
The period when codling moth eggs begin to hatch.
Marks the start of the vulnerable window.

Larva
The damaging stage that enters the fruit.
Once inside the fruit, control options are limited.

Temperature-Driven Development
The concept that codling moth development speeds up in warm conditions
and slows down in cool conditions.


OBSERVATIONS & DATA
-------------------

Trap Data
Information collected from trap checks (date, moths caught, location).

Field Observation
Any observation made by the grower, such as trap catches or fruit damage.

Notes
Optional free-text comments entered by the grower during a trap check.


WHAT CATARINA DOES (SAFE FRAMING)
--------------------------------

Indicates
Suggests a possible condition or trend without certainty.

Highlights
Draws attention to rising risk or important changes.

Supports Planning
Helps growers prepare actions, labor, or supplies.
Does not prescribe actions.

Does NOT Guarantee
Catarina does not guarantee outcomes or replace grower judgment.


TERMS TO AVOID IN THE UI
-----------------------

Population Size
Too precise and misleading for trap data.

Exact Timing
Avoids implying precision or guarantees.

Prescription / Recommendation
Avoids regulatory or advisory implications.

Spray Date / Apply On
Too directive; replace with planning language.


PREFERRED ACTION LANGUAGE
-------------------------

Prepare
Encourages readiness without instruction.

Increase Scouting
Suggests closer observation during higher risk.

Coordinate Supplies
Supports planning for biological controls.

Monitor Closely
Signals importance without prescription.
